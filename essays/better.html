      <h3><strong>Preface</strong></h3>
      <p>I have the pleasure of co-hosting a charming, virtual Meetup every week. Each participant is gifted with a
        random topic and then asked to respond within 60 seconds. What began as a quirky experiment on Zoom has grown
        into a thriving and beloved event.</p>
      <p>Our attendees can’t get enough of these gatherings, and it’s easy to see why. It’s an opportunity to connect
        with new people, explore shared experiences, and promote personal growth. At the end of each session, they leave
        feeling invigorated, cherished, and supported.</p>
      <p>We sprinkle in a dash of friendly competition, asking everyone to vote for the speech that resonated with them
        the most. We keep a tally of the winners and the votes received, adding a layer of exhilarating anticipation to
        our meetings.</p>
      <h3><strong>Authenticity & Vulnerability Speak Louder Than Words</strong></h3>
      <p>As we’ve progressed, some fascinating observations have emerged:</p>
      <p>Often, the poll results show no outright winner. Instead, the authenticity of the speaker’s narrative and the
        voters’ personal preferences or experiences tend to sway the outcome. The most articulate, traditionally
        eloquent speakers don’t always garner more favor than others.</p>
      <p>Vulnerability, it turns out, truly resonates. On rare occasions, under the pressure of time, a speaker might
        struggle to find the perfect story for their topic. Such was the case last week when one attendee was asked to
        recount “her worst date”. For a few moments, she appeared lost in thought, her mind clearly racing to recall a
        fitting anecdote. Despite the pause, her earnest attempt to find an answer, her genuine expressions, and lively
        hand gestures left everyone smiling. In an evening filled with stellar speeches, her candid reflection on “my
        worst date” won the poll for resonating most with the audience.</p>
      <h3><strong>The Path to Confidence: Safety, Diversity, and Repetition</strong></h3>
      <p>Many are daunted by public speaking, envisioning an unattainable ideal of the perfect orator. They place an
        enormous burden on themselves to speak flawlessly and eloquently. Amidst this pressure, they forget to be
        present and connect authentically with the audience. I wish they knew that what truly matters to listeners is an
        original and intriguing story, told with authenticity and presence.</p>
      <p>To grow more confident in impromptu speaking, there are two critical elements: a safe, diverse audience and
        repeated exposure. Genuine, constructive feedback from listeners not only encourages and motivates speakers, but
        also offers valuable insights for growth and improvement.</p>
      <p>As our weekly Meetup demonstrates, it’s not just about crafting the perfect speech—it’s about speaking from the
        heart. So the next time you’re asked to speak, remember: it’s your authenticity and vulnerability that will
        truly resonate with your audience.</p>
