        <p>January 2021</p>
        <p>
          Edit: <a href="https://themouthfuls.com">The Mouthfuls</a> has grown
          to 9,000 members and held 1,200 events since its launch in June 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few months ago, a dear friend, Nancy, requested that I rejoin our
          local Toastmasters club. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the meetings had
          shifted online, a change that had breathed new life into our old
          gatherings. The prospect of reconnecting with old friends and making
          new ones, all while honing my speaking skills, was irresistible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing familiar faces on screen and sharing stories, laughter, and
          knowledge felt rejuvenating. The sheer magic of spoken words, even
          conveyed through a digital medium, was as mesmerizing as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the human warmth of in-person meetings is irreplaceable, I found
          myself secretly relishing the convenience of virtual meetings. Gone
          were the days of battling rush-hour traffic and hunting for parking.
          More than the convenience, however, I discovered three unexpected
          benefits of virtual speaking clubs that many of us might overlook:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Firstly, the online format offered a wider range of club options. I
          was no longer restricted to clubs in my city or neighborhood. We had
          guests joining in from as far as Japan, showcasing the potential of a
          truly global community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, it presented an excellent opportunity for camera training.
          This skill is invaluable in today’s digital age, where reaching a
          global audience through platforms like YouTube or presenting ourselves
          effectively in video conferences is crucial.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thirdly, the online format helped tone down the ‘stage performance’
          aspect. This resonated with me, as my line of work values genuine and
          effortless interaction over a polished stage presence.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As things slowly move towards normalcy, the club plans to resume
          in-person meetings at Edithvale, a location 40 kilometers away from my
          home. This raised a significant question: What next?
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking inspiration from the saying “necessity is the mother of
          invention,” I decided to create Mouthful, an innovative solution for
          people like me who have a passion for spoken words but are constrained
          by time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mouthful is a social network and app that connects individuals who
          love speaking and desire a platform that is efficient, enjoyable, and
          fosters growth. We aspire to give our members more practice in each
          meeting and provide useful feedback to aid their progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Mouthful, you can speak in a group, publish your speeches, and
          watch how others approach the same topic. An AI speech coach, AR
          filters, and avatars that protect your privacy while establishing an
          online presence are part of the package. Moreover, Mouthful brings
          social media features to keep the interaction engaging and
          interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word ‘Mouthful’ might bring to mind a long, complex phrase that’s
          hard to pronounce, but ‘say a mouthful’ refers to something
          noteworthy. Isn’t that a perfect metaphor for our journey in public
          speaking? We start as clumsy orators but gradually evolve to deliver
          impactful speeches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve seen numerous talented professionals,
          particularly new immigrants, struggling to escalate their careers due
          to a lack of effective communication skills. An alarming 77% of people
          fear public speaking, which results in 10% lower wages and a 15%
          lesser chance of promotion to a management role. This is why we need
          more accessible solutions like Mouthful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in the transformative power of being heard. Seeing the spark
          in someone’s eyes when they realize that their voice matters is an
          unparalleled joy. I presented the idea to my co-founder and brother,
          who had served as a club officer twice. We were immediately hooked on
          the concept and are excited to announce the pre-release of an MVP in
          February.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join us in this revolutionary journey, and let’s say a ‘mouthful’
          together!
