    <h1>Bridging Divides: A Glimpse into India’s Caste System</h1> <!-- Insert the document title in h1 style -->
  <p>February 2021</p><p>There is something intriguing about exploring cultures and societies far removed from our own. It’s like opening a window to another world that forces us to question our own beliefs and expand our understanding of the human condition. My own such moment of revelation came during a trip to India in 2015.</p><p>I was visiting a coworker’s family in Kerala, a beautiful state situated on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. Here, I saw the lingering traces of the caste system, an intricate social hierarchy that, despite numerous efforts, still permeates parts of Indian society.</p><p>One evening, a young man, quiet yet attentive, came over to the family home. He was welcomed warmly with cups of fragrant chai tea and became part of our small gathering, joining in the games and laughter. Later, I learned that this man belonged to a lower caste than my coworker’s family, yet he was embraced as one of their own. He cared for the elderly parents while their children were working overseas, and the family in turn treated him with respect and acceptance.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021, and a film caught my eye that once again pulled me into the complicated world of India’s caste system. “The White Tiger” shines a spotlight on the lives of India’s poorer castes. Through the story of its protagonist, the film opened a window into their world, showing their homes, their families, their dreams, and their struggles.</p><p>Of course, it would be overly simplistic to try and fully comprehend such a complex reality through a work of fiction. Yet, it was impossible to resist empathizing with the lead character. Despite the film’s exploration of uncomfortable moral questions, the narrative tugged at my emotions, much like Walter White in “Breaking Bad” did for so many viewers.</p><p>Critics of the film argued that it presented a negative portrayal of India, but I felt the story could have been set in any country. It was a tale of rising from poverty, of the difficult choices and compromises that such a journey often entails. These are universal challenges, not confined to any single culture or society.</p><p>Watching “The White Tiger” filled me with a profound sense of empathy, as well as some discomfort. As someone who has never had to walk in the protagonist’s shoes, who has never been deprived of basic rights or treated as less than human because of my social status, I found myself withholding quick judgments on the moral issues presented in the film.</p><p>Understanding the diverse and complicated world we live in requires empathy and an open mind. It’s essential to approach different cultures and societal systems with a desire to learn rather than judge. After all, we are all shaped by our unique experiences and circumstances, and acknowledging this diversity is the first step towards building bridges of understanding.</p>
