        <p>(Edit: In hindsight, I couldn’t be more wrong in this essay. Read at your own expense.)</p>
        <p>
          The financial world is a swirling vortex of data, where
          interconnections and correlations shape the marketplace. One
          relationship, in particular, has piqued my interest recently – the
          inverse correlation between U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and equity
          valuations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In theory, when these yields rise, equity valuations decline due to a
          higher discount rate. Tech stocks, dependent on growth factors, are
          especially sensitive to this yield change.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>A Recent Case Study</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Over the past couple of months, we’ve seen this correlation in action.
          The 10-year Treasury yield climbed from 0.93% on January 4 to 1.64% on
          March 12, marking a considerable increase of 70 basis points. In the
          same timeframe, the NASDAQ-100 index, a tech-heavy indicator, dipped
          from a high of 13,807.70 to a low of 12,299.62. This 11% decrease over
          mere weeks raises intriguing questions: Were these downward trends
          temporary fluctuations spurred by investor sentiment, or are we
          witnessing more permanent asset value corrections?
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Historical Context</strong></h3>
        <p>
          To make sense of the current situation, let’s cast our eyes back to
          two similar periods: the low yields of 2012 and 2016.

        <h3><strong>The 2012 Climb</strong></h3>
        <p>
          In July 2012, amid the Eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis, investors
          rushed to safe-haven debt, causing the yield to plummet. However, as
          the graph shows, the NASDAQ-100 trended upward over the next couple of
          years despite occasional turbulence. A strong positive correlation of
          0.87 emerged, with no inversion between tech stocks and yield over a
          more extended 18 to 24 month timeframe.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
        </p>
        <h3><strong>The 2016 Climb</strong></h3>
        <p>
          In July 2016, decade-long weak global GDP growth led to
          an all-time low yield of 1.37%. With some countries experiencing
          negative yields, U.S. Treasury bonds appeared more attractive. Despite
          a few bumps, the NASDAQ rose steadily, mirroring the positive
          correlation (0.82) of 2012.
        </p>

            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
        </p>
        <h3><strong>The Future of Tech Stocks</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The recent yield increase and the subsequent tech sell-off seem to be
          driven more by panic-induced selling, short-term profit-taking, and
          sector-rotation, rather than a fundamental shift in asset values.
          Investors appear to be reallocating capital towards financials and
          cyclicals, anticipating broader economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I believe yield-led volatility will soften as investors grow
          more comfortable with yield movements and can better absorb
          fluctuations. After capitalizing on the expected rebound growth, many
          investors are likely to return to the tech sector, given the sector’s
          potential for sustainable high growth, particularly in the area of
          disruptive innovation.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
        <p>
          While the financial landscape is continually shifting, it’s the
          political and regulatory risks that concern me the most. Issues such
          as legislative pressures from the Biden administration, including
          potential anti-trust actions, and fragmented global markets due to
          rising nationalism pose significant threats. These topics are
          expansive enough to warrant separate discussions – so stay tuned for
          more insights in my future posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the dynamics between treasury yields and tech stocks,
          though complex, can provide valuable insights for investment
          strategies. But as always, keep in mind that every investment carries
          risk, and it’s crucial to conduct thorough research before making any
          financial decisions.
        </p>
        <p>Until next time, happy investing!</p>
