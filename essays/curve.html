      <p>April 2020</p>
      <p>New COVID-19 cases are emerging in tens of thousands four months after the initial outbreak in China in
        December 2019. The virus has led to the greatest recession since the 1930s: tourism and hospitality tanked,
        consumers quarantined, millions of jobs lost, global supply chain disrupted, capital investment stemmed, stock
        markets volatile and people depressed from being indoors for weeks.</p>
      <p>Everyone is unsure how long it will take for a vaccine, treatment or contact-tracing technology to be broadly
        adopted. 6 months? 12 months? 18 months? Until then, the virus will continue to haunt the confidence to reopen
        the economy. Countries who argue to reopen early cannot solve (A) consumers’ FOGO or “fear of going out”; (B)
        isolate their economy from the rest of the world; (C) growing deaths and illnesses.</p>
      <p>More than ever, the world needs political leadership and decisiveness, so every country acts concurrently to
        flatten and shorten the curve (read: slapping the faces of any country that only loosely quarantines or
        prematurely reopen their economy).</p>
      <p>Imagine – The world economy shuts down simultaneously. Citizens stay home to minimize physical contact with one
        another. The ones already infected with COVID-19, asymptomatic or not, recover at home or in a hospital.
        Overseas citizens remain where they are. New cases are rigorously investigated. Medical staff stay on-premise
        and have the necessary equipment (e.g. N95). Essential services are contactless. Payments stop, including
        mortgages, commercial loans, rent/lease, etc. Governments support low-income families or vulnerable businesses.
      </p>
      <p>In this scenario, the world would beat the virus and reopen the economy in only 8 weeks. See graphs:</p>

      </p>

      <p>Note: The analysis assumes that unreported, mild or asymptomatic infections represent 20 times reported cases,
        2 weeks of incubation, 2 weeks of recovery for mild infections, 6 weeks of recovery for severe infections, 6% of
        severe cases die within 6 weeks, and the world population grows at 1.1% per year.</p>
      <p>Now is the time when conformity trumps civil-liberty, tough-love social-niceties, and autocracy democracy.</p>
      <p>Bill Gates said, “…what we need is extreme shutdown, so that in six to ten weeks if things go well, you can
        start opening back up” in this<a
